# Advent of code 2020 in Rust
I'm learning a bit of rust and I decided to give the [Aoc-2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) challenge a try.

The solutions won't be pretty or fast but I'll try my best!

25/12/2020: I had a blast going through Aoc puzzles they were amazing (some really hard, cough cough day 20 cough cough).
Rust was really fun to play with, I still have some problems with it and I'm still fighting a bit with the borrow checker (a lot less than at the start) but I really love how fast it is, even with my spaghetti code.

## Have a Wonderful Holiday Season Everyone!
